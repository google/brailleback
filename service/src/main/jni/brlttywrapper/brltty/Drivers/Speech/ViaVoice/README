This directory contains the BRLTTY speech synthesizer driver for the ViaVoice
[http://www.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/ttssdk_linux.html] text to speech
engine from International Business Machines (IBM) [http://www.ibm.com]. It was
implemented, and is being maintained, by Dave Mielke <dave@mielke.cc>.

BRLTTY's configure script automatically includes this driver if ViaVoice's
software development kit has been installed. The default is to check the
directories /usr, /usr/local, /usr/local/ViaVoice, /usr/local/viavoice,
/opt/ViaVoice, and /opt/viavoice. The actual location can be explicitly
specified via --with-viavoice.

This driver can be either dynamically loaded (at run time) or built directly
into a dynamically linked BRLTTY binary (via --with-speech-driver), but it
cannot be built into a statically linked BRLTTY binary (via
--enable-standalone-programs) because ViaVoice's run time kit doesn't contain a
static archive. 

The path to the ini file is determined via the following huristic. If the
driver parameter "inifile" is set, then that value is used. If it isn't, but if
the environment variable "ECIINI" is set, then that value is used. If neither
is set, then the default (/usr/lib/ViaVoiceTTS/eci.ini) is used.

This driver recognizes the following additional parameters (see the file
tts.pdf in the ViaVoice documentation directory for details):
