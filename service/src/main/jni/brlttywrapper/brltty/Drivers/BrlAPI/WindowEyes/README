Starting from version 7.0, WindowEyes can use OEM-provided drivers, this is
such driver for making it use the BrlAPI interface.

It can be added by
* copying bin/webrloem109.dll and bin/brlapi-0.5.dll to the window eyes
directory, along wineyes.exe,
* copy/pasting the content of braille.ini into your braille.ini (found in the
Application Data\GW Micro\Window-Eyes/users/default/ ), and in the same file,
appending the following two lines to the [BrailleDisplays] section:

brl##=oem109
brl###=oem109-raw

where ## and ### are the numbers right after the last one of that section, e.g.
if there was

brl55=zephyr

then these lines should be added:

brl56=oem109
brl57=oem109-raw

Restart WindowEyes, two BrlAPI choices should now appear last in the list.

- BrlAPI generic should work with any device, as it binds the brltty commands to
  WindowEyes commands.
- BrlAPI device-specific permits to define device-specific bindings: WindowEyes
  will get keyboard keycode as such, the user can then bind them at will from
  the WindowEyes interface.

Note that here the Com1/Com2 parameter does not refer to an actual serial
device (the serial/usb configuration shall be done in brltty.conf), it refers to
how keycodes should be reported to WindowEyes: Com1 should always be used for
BrlAPI generic, and Com2 for BrlAPI device-specific.
