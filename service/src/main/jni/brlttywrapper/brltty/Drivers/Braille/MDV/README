Braille display driver for MDV displays

Written by Stéphane Doyon (s.doyon@videotron.ca) in collaboration with
Simone Dal Maso <sdalmaso@protec.it>.

This is version 0.8 (August 2000) of this driver.
It is being tested on MB408S, should also support MB208 and MB408L.

Set MDV to use protocol 5.

This version adds a lot to the previously released version, and attempts to
correct a bug in the last alpha development version. However the current
version has not been tested yet, I am still waiting for feedback, so it is not
impossible for it to be completely broken!
