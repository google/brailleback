Supported Hardware
==================

This driver is supposed to work with any spanish ECO braille display from the 
ECO xx series, including the ECO 20, the ECO 40 and the ECO 80.

If you want any information about ECO and its products, you can look
at http://www.once.es/.

Port Settings
-------------
In the file 'Makefile' located in the BRLTTY home directory, there is a 
line where you can define the default (i.e. when not given on the command 
line) serial port device (such as /dev/ttyS0).  The baudrate setup is 
however defined in the braille.h file.

By default, the ECO communicates at 19200 Baud. 


Running the Driver
==================

To compile and run BRLTTY, please refer to the documentation about 
BRLTTY itself.  One note though: when BRLTTY starts, it will display 
on the screen some copyright stuff, current configuration (model and 
firmware version setup) and the serial device in use.  That information 
may be useful if nothing happens with the braille terminal.

You may run BRLTTY even if no ECO is plugged to the appropriate serial
port.  BRLTTY will wait for it.

You need power on the eco braille line before to use.
