BRLTTY TODO - March 30, 2000
============================

(This concerns the main module of BRLTTY.  Individual Braille terminal
drivers may have their own TODO lists.)

Your help is welcome.

- Defining smaller regions of the screen to be concentrated on.  Cursor
  movement outside the current region would be ignored.  This would be
  useful if the screen was split into multiple `windows' (e.g. in ytalk).

- Attribute tracking (scroll bars, etc.)

- Revision of beeps.  Too many events have the same beeps, so we might want
  to add new ones. See if we could optimize the use of the console resource.
  Implement .au and .wav sounds (through a soundcard).

- Scroll tracking: wouldn't it be great if you could continue reading the
  line you're on even when new text is printed and the screen scrolls up?
  Like in IRC for instance...

- Better speech support.

- Support for more Braille displays.

- Port to other Unix platforms.  Since all Linux dependent functions are now
  modularized in separate source files, it would be easy to write other 
  modules to make BRLTTY usable with the screen package or such and then 
  become available for any other Unix platform.  An experimental patch is 
  available in the Patches/ directory.
