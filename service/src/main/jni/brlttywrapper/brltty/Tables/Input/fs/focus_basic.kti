# This key subtable is for all FreedomScientific Focus displays.

note There are two Nav controls - one at each side of the top.
note * Each has three actions: Up, Down, and Press.
note * On some models, a Nav control is a wheel which can be both rolled and pressed.
note * On others, it's an up/down rocker along with a separate pressable button.
note The Selector keys are at either end of the front edge.
note * On older models, they're known as GDF (General Display Function) keys.
note The Advance keys are just inside the rockers and outside the shift keys.
